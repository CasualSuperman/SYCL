# SYCL Proposal

## Purpose
*	To write a license that ensures proper credit to the author of code.
*	To allow authors to transfer ownership rights to other parties.
	
	_Reasoning: Making the license usable by companies that require employees
	to forfeit rights to code._
*	To allow authors to forfeit ownership rights into the Public Domain in the
	future, if they wish.

## Goals
*	To keep code under the SYCL open.

	_(This means no incorporating SYCL'd code in closed-source projects without
	proper credit.)_

	_(This also means that code released under the SYCL which has been modified
	__must__ be made available, unlike the GPL and LGPL.)_ 
*	To allow code under the SYCL to be used with code under other Free
 	licenses.
*	Software using code released under the SYCL can only be sold with the
	copyright holder's permission.
