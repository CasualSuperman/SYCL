SYCL Proposal
=============

Purpose
-------
*	To write a license that ensures proper credit to the author of code.
*	To allow authors to transfer ownership rights to other parties.
 	  Reasoning: Usable by companies that require employees to forfeit rights
 	  	to code.
*	To allow authors to forfeit ownership rights into the Public Domain.

Goals
-----
*	To keep code under the SYCL open.
 	  (This means no incorporating SYCL'd code in closed-source projects)
*	To allow code under the SYCL to be used with code under other Free
 	licenses.
