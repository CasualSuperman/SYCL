# SYCL Proposal

## Purpose
*	To write a license that ensures proper credit to the author of code.
*	To allow authors to transfer ownership rights to other parties.
	
	_Reasoning: Usable by companies that require employees to forfeit rights
 	to code._
*	To allow authors to forfeit ownership rights into the Public Domain.

## Goals
*	To keep code under the SYCL open.

	_(This means no incorporating SYCL'd code in closed-source projects without
	proper credit.)_
*	To allow code under the SYCL to be used with code under other Free
 	licenses.
*	To prevent monetization by others of solely SYCL'd code.
