# SYCL Proposal

## Purpose
*	To write a license that ensures proper credit to the author of code.
*	To allow authors to transfer ownership rights to other parties.
	
	_Reasoning: Making the license usable by companies that require employees
	to forfeit rights to code._
*	To allow authors to forfeit ownership rights into the Public Domain in the
	future, if they wish.

## Goals
*	To keep code under the SYCL open.

	_(This means no incorporating SYCL'd code in closed-source projects without
	proper credit.)_

	_(This also means that code released under the SYCL which has been modified
	**must** be made available, unlike the GPL and LGPL.)_
*	To allow code under the SYCL to be used with code under other Free
 	licenses. _(Non-infectious)_
*	Software using code released under the SYCL can only be sold with the
	copyright holder's permission.
*	Automatic forfeiting of rights granted by the License if patent litigation
	is raised. (Patent Retaliation)
*	Weak CopyLeft.
		"A 'Weak' copyleft license says that all changes to this particular
		code must be released, but other software can be built using this as a
		library, and that can software can be under a different license."

## Miscellaneous
*	Avoid having to include the text of the license in the projects that use it.
*	Since this means that an online version must be available, all online
	copies must have a method of showing and linking to previously hosted
	versions of the license, or never update them.
*	Reciprocal, want code back.
